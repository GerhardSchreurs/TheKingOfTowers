# TheKingOfTowers

An exploit to harvest resources in the king of towers.

# This program is for demonstration purposes only. It showcases an exploit in the Shinzone game called "The King of Towers", which enables you to harvest money and other resources. Please use this program for eductional purposes only.

This program basically does the following:

* Restarts the level "Circa Lake" untill the Treasure Hunter appears (around 11.1% chance according to calculations made by others).
* If treasure hunter appears, kill him and take the resources
* Repeat

This program is a simple demonstration program that only works if you have the exact same setup as I have:

* Resolution: 1920 x 1080
* Chrome browser maximized, with the first tab hosting the game
* The king of towers running without additional content (frames or other content that changes the position of the game). EG: http://towerdefense-y8.shinezone.com/main.php
* In Chrome, the bookmarks bar is visible

# Note: this setup might not work anymore once Google changes the skin of Chrome, or the developers change the position of buttons and such in the game.
